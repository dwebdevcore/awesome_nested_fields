awesome_nested_fields
=====================

Easy dynamic nested fields for Rails and jQuery applications.

Installation
------------

1. Add this line to the Gemfile:

    gem 'awesome_nested_fields'

2. Include the `jquery.nested-fields.js` file to your template (or to the pages that will use nested fields):

    <script src="/javascripts/jquery.nested-fields.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    
Don't forget to include this file _after_ you've included jQuery.


Compatibility
-------------

awesome_nested_fields works only on Rails 3 and jQuery 1.4.4 or above.
