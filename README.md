awesome_nested_fields
=====================

Easy dynamic nested fields for Rails and jQuery applications.

Installation
------------

1. Add this line to your Gemfile:

        gem 'awesome_nested_fields'
    
2. Include the `jquery.nested-fields.js` file to your template (or to the pages that will use nested fields):
    
        <script src="/javascripts/jquery.nested-fields.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

3. Now, you're ready to rock with nested models.
    
Don't forget to include the file _after_ you've included jQuery. And don't worry because this file isn't on the public folder: it comes bundled into the gem.


Compatibility
-------------

awesome_nested_fields works only on Rails 3 and jQuery 1.4.4 or above.
